 VPC Creation 
======================
       User creating the Private Network inside AWS Region
       VPC Provides the Network Connnection to the That Particular Region
       VPC can be created via AWS GUI,AWS CLI, AWS SDK Methods
       Per region we can create 5 vpc maxumum
       VPC are 2 Types: Default VPC and Custom VPC
       Default VPC Created and attached by the AWS itself in the All the Regions
       Custom VPC Created by the User Manually 
       Default-VPC can be deleted and restored
       Custom-VPC once deleted we cant restore
       If the resources are running under the VPC we cant delete the VPC, If we to delete the VPC first delete the resources are running under the VPC
       VPC are created via Ipv4/Ipv6 Addressing Structure
       VPC are created as Ipv4 Addressing Structure only the Private ip addressing are Allowed to create the VPC (10.0.0.0/172.16.0.0/192.168.0.0)
       VPC subnets are created via CIDR Addressing Calculations (subneeting)
       VPC subnets are Two types (Private Subnets,Public Subnets)
       Private Subnet means the traffic will not routable or reachable to internet Access (Local Access)
       Public Subnet Means the Traffic will reachable or routable to the Internet Access (Global Access)
       As subnets are 2 types we have Route Table Also Two Types (Public-RT/Private-RT)
       All subnets should be connected with via Route table
       VPC subnet traffic must redirect to the Route tables
       All subnet traffic will go the Route Table
       Route table decides which subnet have to go Global Access and Which Subnet have to go Local Access
       We have to associate the subnets to the Route table
       Internet Gateway is a Process to provide the internet access to the Public-RT
       Internet Gateway do the NAT Process and Provide Internet access to the Public ip EC2 Servers
       
   VPC Conditions
=======================

       If the EC2 Machine have the Public ip attached but No Internet Gateway This means its a Private 
       if the EC2 Machine have the No Public ip attached but it have Internet Gateway Attached also this means its a Private
       if the EC2 Server Have the Public ip and Internet Gateway Attached this means its a Public
   
    Public ip Address
=========================

       General Public ip address: This General Public ip is a temp address and its a free public ip no cost
                                  General Public ip by default we can enable for all the subnets under the VPC

       Elastic ip address: This Method of the Public ip address is Permanent Public ip to the EC2 Server This is Charged Per hour
                           This EIP will not be given by the AWS Automatically. User have to request and get the EIP from the AWS which is charged per hour


    VPC Rules
===========================

       Per VPC we have seperate Internet Gateway
       One Internet Gateway cant be shared between 2 vpc
       Each subnet can have the seperate RT
       10 Subnets we can have One RT
       One VPC Cant Communicate with other VPC 
       iF 2 VPC want to communicate with each other we need establish peering connections or Via Transist Gateway 
   

  VPC Security
=============================

     VPC Have 2 Firewalls to protect the EC2 Servers from the Attacks
     1) NACL (Network Access Control List or Subnet Level Firewall)
        Allow/Deny Rules
        NACL will allow the Traffic based on the Hirerchial order (40,30,20,10   -  10,20,30,40)
        Blocking the Complete subnet of the VPC 

     2) Security Groups (Instance Level Firewall)
        Security Groups Have no Deny Rules it have allow rules
        Blocks the Traffic at the EC2 Instance Level
        1 instance must have one sg Attached
        1 instance can be connected to 5 Sg
        SG will follow the Rules of the NACL 

 
 How The Traffic Flow Comes to the VPC
=============================================
  
     1) Traffic come to (Internet Gateway) -------------> Blocking
     2) Traffic come to (NACL) ---------------> Blocking
     3) Traffic come to (SG) ---------------> Blocking
     4) Traffic go the EC2 Server


Public Ip And Private Ip
=============================================

  Public Ip  
  
     Traffic comes from the Internet Network
     Public ip are registered Ip address
     Public ip are charged
     Public ip brings outside traffic to the Machine

  Private Ip

     Traffic will route internally
     Its secure
     EC2 Server will get the Private ip from the VPC subnet
     Ec2 Server cant be without Private ip but Ec2 Server can be without public ip
     Private ip are Free
     

  Private Ip Working Process
=================================
 
   VPC ----> Subnets ------> RT ---> ---> NACL -----> SG ----> Internet Gateway -------------> Internet Access
(10.0.0.0/26) S1/S2/S3      s1/s2/s3
